# GLCFS-Python-Data-Access
A library written in python to access public data from the Great Lakes Coastal Forecasting System from NOAA and parse it.

## About
This project is to make it easier for me to get data about the great lakes to see forecasts for things like waves.

All of this data is from the Great Lakes Forecasting System (https://www.glerl.noaa.gov/res/glcfs/) from the Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory, which is part of NOAA. Thank you to Greg Lang for helping me get set up with the data.

This project also uses Pandas and NumPy.

## Data
The data comes from this link on the GLERL site: https://www.glerl.noaa.gov/emf/glcfs/gridded_fields/
